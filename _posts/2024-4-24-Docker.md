# To bring Docker images from Docker Hub to your system and run them, you'll need to follow these steps:

# Step 1: Install Docker

Make sure Docker is installed on your system. You can download and install Docker Desktop from the official Docker website.

# Step 2: Pull Docker Images

Open a terminal or command prompt and pull the Docker images from Docker Hub using the docker pull command. Replace <image_name> with the actual names of the images you want to pull.
docker pull <image_name>

For example, if your images are named mysql_image for the MySQL image and flask_app_image for the Flask app image, you would run:
docker pull mysql_image
docker pull flask_app_image

# Step 3: Run MySQL Docker Container

Run the MySQL Docker container using the pulled MySQL image. Make sure to specify a password for the root user and expose the necessary port (e.g., 3306).
docker run -d --name mysql_container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<password> -p 3306:3306 mysql_image

# Step 4: Run Flask App Docker Container

Run the Flask app Docker container using the pulled Flask app image. Make sure to link it to the MySQL container so the Flask app can access the MySQL database.
docker run -d --name flask_app_container --link mysql_container:mysql -p 5000:5000 flask_app_image

# Step 5: Access Flask App

Now, you should be able to access your Flask app by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:5000. Your Flask app should be running and connected to the MySQL database.
